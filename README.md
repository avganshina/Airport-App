# Airport-App
Many international travelers arrive at JFK International Airport each day. They can be foreigners or US citizens. In order to go through customs and enter the US, there are certain qualities that they need to attain. For example, foreigners must have a valid US Visa and have either clean background or have committed a minor crime that has already been explained. Both US citizens and foreigners need to not be bringing unknown substances or things that are prohibited into the country. If any of these qualities aren’t met, the particular visitor won’t be able to enter the US. Design a system for the authorities to use to store information on travelers and to quickly look them up upon arrival.
